      <h2>Master Your Scripts with this casual game.</h2>
      <p>
        Are you struggling to memorize your scripts for your next presentation
        or speech? Take a quick break from your boring memorization routine and
        have a bit of fun for once. You will be surprised how much it can help!
        Here's how it works:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Write your script, copy and paste it, or drag and drop it into the editor.</li>
        <li>Click the "Next" button to start the game.</li>
        <li>
          Read the paragraph and click "Next" to move on to the next section. (you can also press the right arrow key)
        </li>
        <li>
          As you progress, a few words will be missing from each section. Fill
          in the gaps from memory.
        </li>
        <li>
          The number of gaps will increase with each round, challenging you to
          remember more and more of the script.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you need help, just click on any placeholder and the missing word
          will be revealed.
